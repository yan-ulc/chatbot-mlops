    "\n",
    "2.\tAPI Gateway → Bot Manager\n",
    "    - The API Gateway hands the message to the Bot Manager.\n",
    "    - The Bot Manager is the brain of the system — it decides what to do with the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tBot Manager (Different Paths), Depending on the type of message, the Bot Manager has multiple options:\n",
    "    - Detect Intent: Understands what the user wants (e.g., track order, ask about a product, FAQs).\n",
    "    - Extract Information: Pulls key details like order ID, product name, or location.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Search Knowledge (Vector + Keywords):\n",
    "        - Looks up answers from the Product Catalog or FAQs.\n",
    "        - Uses two techniques: keyword search (Elasticsearch) and meaning-based search (FAISS).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Generate Answer (LLM + RAG):\n",
    "        - If the answer needs to be written out more naturally, it asks a language model.\n",
    "        - The model uses retrieved context so the answer is factual and not hallucinated.\n",

    "    - Human Agent (Fallback): If the system isn’t confident, it sends the chat to a real person.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tFinal Response → User Chat UI\n",
    "    - Whatever action is chosen (search, database lookup, LLM, or human agent), the Bot Manager puts together a final response.\n",

    "    - Search Model → Learns to find the right info in the catalog or knowledge base.\n",
    "    - Answer Generator → Learns to generate natural, human-like responses.\n",
    "6.\tEvaluate Models\n",
    "    - Test each model to see how well it performs (accuracy, precision, recall).\n",
    "    - Only good models move forward.\n",
